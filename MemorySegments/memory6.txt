In my macOS, the range of process space map is 
from 0x0000_0000 to 0xffff_ffff
But, I couldn't find exact range of segments of local variables, grobal variables, functions and malloced memory.
From result of first and third experiment, I think I can distinguish local variable and grobal variable.
I think it's difficult to distinguish segments of local variable, functions and malloced memory.
